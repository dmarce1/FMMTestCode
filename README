This code will compile under g++ using the command:

g++ *.cpp -std=c++11


NOTES: 

1) To enable the angular momentum conservation feature, define "CORRECTION_ON". To enable the optimized version of the correction, 
   define "CORRECTION_ON" and "CORRECTION_OPTIMIZE." See defs.hpp.

2) The first calculation is the direct force calculation used for comparison and may take some time. To run a quicker test, reduce
   the number of particles (see note 3)

3) To change the number of particles, change the value of "constexpr integer nparts" in defs.hpp.
